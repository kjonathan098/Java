        Inheriting protos from other objects is extremely dangerous and can create a lot of conflicts. 

        Lets say you have an animal constructor that has a func of eating and walking 

        Now you add a new animal Goldfish which needs to swim and not walk.. In the case youll need to break the constructor and a grandpa for eating add parents for either walking and swiming and create grind childs 

        There is a better solution which is called Compositions

        REMEMBER TO KEEP IT SIMPLE AND STUPID 

        The idea is to define different indepent features that can be passed to any object you need
