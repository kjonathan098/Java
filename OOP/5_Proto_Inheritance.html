        In this lesson Mosh takes thing a bit further.. He creates a shape constructor and adds a duplicate function in its proto

        Then creates a circle constructor and instead of defining the duplicate function again just inherits it from the shape constructor 

        A - Create your parent proto 

            function Shape() {}
			    Shape.prototype.duplicate = function () {
				console.log('duplicating ')
			}

			const newShape = new Shape()
			console.log(newShape)

        B - Create your child 

        	function Circle(radius) {
				this.radius = radius
			}

			const newCircle = new Circle(1)
			console.log(newCircle.radius)

        C - What I think were doing now is replacing the Circle prototype base with the Shape base that includes the new function


            Circle.
        
        D - So we are actually re-setting the protype meaning were erasing the constructor thats why you need to re-create the constructor again manually 

            Circle.prototype.constructor = Circle

        */

			function Shape() {}
			Shape.prototype.duplicate = function () {
				console.log('duplicating ')
			}

			const newShape = new Shape()
			console.log(newShape)

			function Circle(radius) {
				this.radius = radius
			}

			Circle.prototype = Object.create(Shape.prototype)
			Circle.prototype.constructor = Circle

			const newCircle = new Circle(1) 
			console.log(newCircle)
		</script>
