			     Now that weve learned how actual constructor object work lets see how classes work in JS IS6 we have classes that are synthetic sugar to write functional objects and implement inheretance much easier


			     CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION

			     function Human(name){
			         this.name = name
			         this.walk = function(){
			             log('walking...')
			         }
			     }

			     ES6 CLASSES

			 A - Start with the class keyword, name of class and {} (this is called the body of the class )

			     class Human { }


			 B - Now we need to write our constructor method

			     class Human {
			         constructor(name){
			             this.name = name
			         }

			      }

			 C - There are two way to write methods

			      1) In the body of the class which will write the method in the prototype
			      2) In the constructor method which will be added in the object itself


			 D - To write a proto method follow this syntax

			       class Human {
			         constructor(name){
			             this.name = name
			         }

			         walk(){
			             log('walking...')
			         }

			      }

			 E - Write a method in the Instance

			         class Human {
			         constructor(name){
			             this.name = name
			             this.eat = function(){
			                 log('eating..')
			             }
			         }

			         walk(){
			             log('walking...')
			         }

			      }




			     */

			class Human {
				constructor(name, food) {
					this.name = name
					this.eat = function () {
						console.log(`eating ${this.food}`)
					}
				}
				walk() {
					console.log('walking...')
				}
			}

			const pedro = new Human('Pedro', 'Pizza')
			console.log(pedro)
