			/*
        
        So far we have learned how to create methods (proto or object) but in the instance itself 

        const newHuman = new Human
        newHuman.walk

        We have a another concept called static methods which are methods defined in the class itself not in the instance 

            EX 

            - Math.floor
            - Math.random
            - Math.max

            This are all static methods found in the class Math usually used for utility functions


        Lets try it 

        A - create a normal class 

            class Human {
                constructor(name){
                    this.name =name
                }
                walk(){
                    log('walking...')
                }

            }

        B - Create a static method in the class by simply adding the static keyword 

            class Human {
                constructor(name){
                    this.name =name
                }
                walk(){
                    log('walking...')
                }
                static eat(){
                    log('eating...')
                }

            }
        
        C - Now this method is not gonna be available in the new instance created 

        const juan = new Human 
        juan.eat() = ERROR

        D - You can invoke by calling the class and accessing the method 

        Human.eat()
        
        
        */

			class Human {
				constructor(name) {
					this.name = name
				}
				walk() {
					console.log('walking...')
				}
				static eat(food) {
					console.log(`eating...${food}`)
				}
			}
