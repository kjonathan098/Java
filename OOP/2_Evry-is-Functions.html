Something cool to learn is that everything we did in the past was actually using a constructor function under the hood to created 


A - When we declare a new string 

    let name = 'John'

    Under the hood JS was executing a const function like this 

    const name = new String("John")

    you can view it by declaring a new var and in the web console type 

    var.constructor


B - To take one level deeper in reality function are OBJ 

    This object has many properties and methods and one of those methods is a constructor to create a new function

    const sayHi () => {
        console.log('hello')
    }

    sayHi.(all the props of this object)

    so every

*/

			let string = 'John'
			let number = 3
			let trueFalse = true

			const sayHi = () => {
				console.log('hello')
			}

			console.log(sayHi.name, 'say Hi name ')
			console.log(sayHi.length, 'say Hi name ')
			console.log(sayHi.prototype, 'say Hi name ')
			console.log(sayHi.constructor, 'say Hi name ')
