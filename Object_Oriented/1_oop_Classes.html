        /*Programming paradigm to represent objects in our program
        
        E.g. how do we represent a cat in our code (with its properties and methods/actions)
        
        We implement a blueprint of our object using classes, and we create an instance of the object.
        
        Each object has methods and properties (fields)*/

        // watch Image in OOP Folder

        class Cat {
            constructor(name, color) {
                this.name = name; // this. refers to the const you are creating. (firstCat, myOtherCat)
                this.color = color;
            }

            makeSound() {
                console.log(`Meow, my name is ${this.name}, and my color is ${this.color}`);
            }
        }

        const firstCat = new Cat("Garfield", "Ginger")
        firstCat.makeSound(); // now there is an object called firstCat which has a method (function) inside of it which you can access. 
        console.log(firstCat)
        const myOtherCat = new Cat("Toulouse", "Brown");
        myOtherCat.makeSound(); // "Meow, my name is Toulouse, and my color is Brown"
        console.log(firstCat)
